# Covid-19 Info
The overview can be filtered by countries and sorted by any of these stats:
- population
- confirmed (current)
- confirmed (last)
- confirmed (change since last in %)
- deaths (current)
- deaths (last)
- deaths (change since last in %)
- case fatality rate (in %)
- infection chance (1 person met)
- infection chance (10 persons met)
- infection chance (50 persons met)
- infection chance (100 persons met)

The filtered results are consolidated in a "totals" row for convenience. 

For further convenience all cells are highlighted according to four categories:
- zero (no color)
- low (yellow)
- medium (orange)
- high (red)

The thresholds for highlighting differ per stat:
- population: no highlight
- confirmed (current; low=100, medium=1000, high=10000)
- confirmed (last; low=100, medium=1000, high=10000)
- confirmed (change since last in %; low=1, medium=25, high=50)
- deaths (current; low=100, medium=1000, high=10000)
- deaths (last; low=100, medium=1000, high=10000)
- deaths (change since last in %; low=1, medium=25, high=50)
- case fatality rate (in %; ; low=1, medium=10, high=25)
- infection chance (1 person met; low=1, medium=25, high=50)
- infection chance (10 persons met; low=1, medium=25, high=50)
- infection chance (50 persons met; low=1, medium=25, high=50)
- infection chance (100 persons met; low=1, medium=25, high=50)
